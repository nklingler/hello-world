Kickin' it Github style!

Hi People of Earth!

I am Nate, getting ready to apply for a design position at Github and thought I would learn what the company / process is about! I enjoy great design, excellent branding, reading about business, politics, typography, all things design, and long walks on the beach. Github recruitment team, if by chance you're reading this I'd love to join the team!
